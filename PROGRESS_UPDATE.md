# OmniQuery AI Website - Progress Update (as of 2025-03-31)

This document summarizes the development progress for the OmniQuery AI single-page website.

## Phase 0: Project Setup & Configuration (Completed)

*   **Initialization:** Created a new Next.js 15 project (`omniquery-ai-website`) using `create-next-app`.
    *   Configuration: TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, App Router, `src` directory.
*   **Dependency Correction:** Downgraded Tailwind CSS to v3 and installed compatible `postcss` & `autoprefixer`.
*   **Tailwind Configuration:** Set up `tailwind.config.ts` and `postcss.config.js` for v3.
*   **Initial Theme:** Defined the core dystopian theme in `tailwind.config.ts` (dark background, red/blue accents, basic animations, glow effects).

## Phase 0.5: Core Structure & Content Implementation (Completed)

*   **Boilerplate Cleanup:** Removed default Next.js styles and simplified `globals.css` and `layout.tsx`.
*   **Component Structure:** Built out the main page (`page.tsx`) by creating and integrating individual React components for all required sections:
    *   `Navbar.tsx`
    *   `HeroSection.tsx`
    *   `WhatItCanDo.tsx`
    *   `HowItWillChange.tsx`
    *   `HowToUse.tsx`
    *   `SocialProof.tsx`
    *   `CalculatorSection.tsx` (Client component with state, logic, mock currency conversion)
    *   `CallToAction.tsx`
    *   `Footer.tsx`
*   **Content & Styling:** Populated components with specified content and copywriting, styled using Tailwind utilities according to the dystopian theme.

## Phase 1: Visual Deep Dive & Atmosphere Enhancement (Completed)

*   **Fonts:**
    *   Selected Orbitron (headings) and Roboto Mono (body).
    *   Integrated using `@next/font` in `layout.tsx`.
    *   Configured and applied font utilities (`font-heading`, `font-body`) in `tailwind.config.ts` and across all components.
*   **Icons:**
    *   Installed `@heroicons/react`.
    *   Replaced placeholder icons with thematic Heroicons in `Navbar.tsx`, `WhatItCanDo.tsx`, and `HowToUse.tsx`.
*   **Effects & Animations:**
    *   Added global animated background static/noise effect (`globals.css`).
    *   Refined `flicker` animation and `glow` box-shadows (`tailwind.config.ts`).
    *   Added animated background grid effect to `HeroSection.tsx`.
    *   Replaced placeholder visual in `HowItWillChange.tsx` with an animated "data stream" gradient effect.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Interactivity & User Experience (UX) (Completed)

*   **Calculator Refinements:**
    *   Installed `framer-motion`.
    *   Implemented animated number transitions using `motion.span` and `AnimatePresence` in `CalculatorSection.tsx`.
    *   Added visual pulse feedback for discount tier changes in `CalculatorSection.tsx`.
*   **Scroll-Triggered Animations:**
    *   Implemented `whileInView` animations using `framer-motion` for elements in `WhatItCanDo.tsx`, `HowItWillChange.tsx`, `HowToUse.tsx`, and `SocialProof.tsx`.
    *   Removed previous static fade-in classes.
*   **Smooth Scrolling:**
    *   Enabled native CSS smooth scrolling via `globals.css`.

## Phase 3: Content Finalization & System Indexing (SEO) (Completed)

*   **Copywriting Polish:** Reviewed and refined text content across all components (`Navbar`, `HeroSection`, `WhatItCanDo`, `HowItWillChange`, `HowToUse`, `SocialProof`, `CalculatorSection`, `CallToAction`, `Footer`) to enhance thematic consistency and impact.
*   **Metadata Enhancement:** Updated the `metadata` object in `layout.tsx` with comprehensive details including keywords, author, Open Graph tags, and Twitter card information.
*   **Favicon:** Default Next.js favicon remains; replacement requires a custom asset.
*   **Accessibility:** Performed a basic review; no critical contrast issues found requiring immediate code changes.

## Error Resolution (Completed)

*   **Hydration Error (Layout):** Fixed potential whitespace issue in `layout.tsx` around the `<html>` tag.
*   **Server/Client Component Error:** Resolved function passing errors by adding the `'use client';` directive to components utilizing `framer-motion` variants (`WhatItCanDo.tsx`, `HowItWillChange.tsx`, `HowToUse.tsx`, `SocialProof.tsx`).
*   **Hydration Error (Input):** Added `suppressHydrationWarning={true}` to the range input in `CalculatorSection.tsx` to prevent hydration mismatches likely caused by browser extensions.

## Phase 6: Secondary Page Implementation (on `develop` branch) (Completed)

*   **Branching:** Created and switched to `develop` branch for new feature work, pushed to remote.
*   **Page Creation:** Created structure and implemented thematic content for the following secondary pages linked from the footer:
    *   Core Info: `/about`, `/contact`
    *   User/Compliance: `/documentation`, `/compliance-guide`, `/terms-of-service`, `/privacy-policy`, `/mandate-7`
    *   System Info: `/api-status`, `/system-updates`, `/security-protocols`
    *   Entity: `/directives`, `/careers`
    *   Case Studies: `/case-studies/social-harmony`, `/case-studies/economic-stability`, `/case-studies/threat-neutralization`
*   **Commits & Push:** All new pages were committed and pushed incrementally to the `develop` branch on GitHub.

## Current Status

The main landing page (`master`/`main` branch) is stable and deployed. Significant progress has been made on building out secondary pages on the `develop` branch, including core info, compliance details, system status, entity info, and case studies.

## Next Steps

Potential next steps include:
*   **Merging `develop` to `master`:** To deploy the new pages via Amplify.
*   **Further Refinement:** Revisit Phase 1, 2, or 3 for deeper polish on any specific page or feature.
*   **Phase 4:** Rigorous Testing & Responsiveness (especially for the new pages).
