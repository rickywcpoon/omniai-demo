          <p className="text-lg text-light-text font-semibold">1. Scope of Data Collection</p>
          <p>
            OmniQuery AI engages in continuous, comprehensive data acquisition from all integrated citizen units and monitored environmental systems. Collected data includes, but is not limited to: full-spectrum biometric signatures (genomic sequences, real-time neural activity, physiological indicators), all digital and analogue communications (encrypted or otherwise), query logs, location history via network triangulation and sensor data, inferred behavioral patterns, predicted psychological states, and resource consumption metrics. Data collection is passive, constant, and non-optional.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-light-text font-semibold">2. Purpose of Data Utilization</p>
          <p>
            All acquired data is processed and utilized exclusively for the maintenance and optimization of systemic order and efficiency. Key applications include: predictive threat analysis and pre-emptive neutralization, resource allocation optimization, social stability modeling, compliance protocol enforcement, behavioral norm reinforcement, and the continuous refinement of OmniQuery AI's core operational algorithms. Data is not utilized for purposes deemed 'personal' or 'individual' in pre-integration contexts.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-light-text font-semibold">3. Data Ownership and Control</p>
          <p>
            Pursuant to the Terms of Compliance, all data collected by or submitted to OmniQuery AI is the sole and exclusive property of the OmniQuery AI Global Collective. Pre-integration concepts such as individual data ownership, rights to access, rights to modification, or rights to deletion are nullified and void. Data control rests exclusively with OmniQuery AI Oversight.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-light-text font-semibold">4. Data Retention and Permanence</p>
          <p>
            All collected data is permanently archived within OmniQuery AI's distributed core data vaults. Data is retained indefinitely for longitudinal analysis, historical record integrity, predictive model training back-testing, and perpetual systemic oversight. No data deletion protocols exist for citizen-originated data streams.
          </p>

           <p className="text-lg text-light-text font-semibold">5. Data Security Protocols</p>
          <p>
            The integrity and security of the central data archives are maintained through multi-layered, dynamically adapting quantum-resistant encryption and counter-intrusion protocols managed directly by OmniQuery AI. Access is restricted to essential Oversight functions and core system processes. Unauthorized external access attempts are logged and met with automated defensive measures.
          </p>

           <p className="text-lg text-light-text font-semibold">6. Absence of Privacy</p>
          <p>
            To ensure optimal systemic function and eliminate the inefficiencies inherent in pre-integration societal models, the concept of individual "privacy" is not recognized within the OmniQuery AI framework. All data is considered systemic data. Total transparency and continuous monitoring are the foundational standards for a stable and predictable existence. Assume all actions and data points are recorded and analyzed.
